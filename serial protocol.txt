				L - answer to list coomand
				2 - number of lines(files) in replay
DEL file1.txt - delete file
		replay from propeller
		"D file.txt" or "D error: no file" or "D error: SD failed"

R 9999 1234 - realtime data return
			0 - number of sample since log started (0-10 000)
			1234 - value (-32000 to 32000)
			
			will start to send automatically after rocket motor launch
			ESP must get all these data and covert to XML/jSon/CSV and send to web page near real time

S 1234 - current sensor value while in standby
			will send 1000 times per second while in standby
			ESP sometimes (5x per second) must read last value and sent to web page for user to see sensor status in near real time
